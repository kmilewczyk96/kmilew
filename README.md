# About this project:
My first website containing finished projects with descriptions.

# Installation:
1. Rename .env.sample to .env
2. Run command "docker compose up" or "docker-compose up" depending on your configuration. (First run will automatically create superuser with credentials    provided in .env file. Alter them if you want to log to django admin panel with different credentials.)
3. Visit localhost:8000/admin and create account for superuser.
4. You can now alter details and add projects displayed on "localhost:8000/".
